nautilus-py-vim is a nautilus extension written in python, which adds several
menu items in the nautilus context menu for gvim, which would popup when right
clicking on the file in nautilus file manager, just like gVim on Windows.

To install this extension, first make sure that you have installed the
nautilus python extension(http://projects.gnome.org/nautilus-python):
On Fedora:          # yum install nautilus-python
On Debian/Ubuntu:   # apt-get install python-nautilus

After that, just run "install.sh":

$ ./install.sh

The above command would make this extension available to you only, not other
users. If you want every user on the machine could use this extension, run the
install.sh with root privilege:

# ./install.sh

If you encounter any problem when executing the command above, try to
execute "bash install.sh" or "ksh install.sh".

Then restart nautilus(execute "nautilus -q") and try to right click on the
file(s) you want to edit, you will see the changes in the context menu("Edit
with gVim" when only one file is selected, and "Diff with gVim", "Edit with
Multi gVim", "Edit with a Single gVim" are present when several files are
selected), just like what it is like on Windows.
