nautilus-py-vim version 0.3

1. Overview

nautilus-py-vim is an extension for nautilus, the GNOME file manager, and is
written in python. This extension adds several menu items in the nautilus
right-click context menu for gvim, just like gVim on Windows.

2. Install

To install this extension, first make sure that you have installed the
nautilus python extension(http://projects.gnome.org/nautilus-python):
On Fedora:          # yum install nautilus-python
On Debian/Ubuntu:   # apt-get install python-nautilus

If you want to enable the "Edit with gVim as Root" menu item, you should
install gksu(http://www.nongnu.org/gksu),
beesu(http://honeybeenet.altervista.org/beesu) or
kdesu(http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/kdesu):

On Fedora:          # yum install beesu
On Debian/Ubuntu:   # apt-get install gksu

After that, just run "install.sh":

$ ./install.sh

The above command would make this extension available to you only, not other
users. If you want every user on the machine could use this extension, run the
install.sh with root privilege:

# ./install.sh

If you encounter any problem when executing the command above, try to execute
"bash install.sh" or "ksh install.sh".

Then restart nautilus(execute "nautilus -q") and try to right click on the
file(s) you want to edit, you will see the changes in the context menu("Edit
with gVim" when only one file is selected, and "Diff with gVim", "Edit with
Multi gVim", "Edit with a Single gVim" are present when several files are
selected), just like what it is like on Windows.

3. Configuration

To configure the extension, you could write a config file. nautilus-py-vim
will search the config file in the order of the following files:

~/.nautilusvim.conf
~/.nautilus/nautilusvim.conf
/etc/nautilusvim.conf

For the content of the config file, you could take a look at the
"example.conf".

If none of the configuration files are found, nautilus-py-vim will use default
values.

4. Uninstall

Run the uninstall shell script.
