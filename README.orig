nautilus-py-vim version 0.1

nautilus-py-vim is a nautilus python extension which adds several menu items
in the nautilus context menu for gvim, which would popup when right clicking
on the file in nautilus file manager, just like gVim on Windows.

To install this plugin, first make sure that you have installed the
nautilus python extension(http://projects.gnome.org/nautilus-python):
On Fedora:          # yum install nautilus-python
On Debian/Ubuntu:   # apt-get install python-nautilus

Then make the directory "~/.nautilus/python-extensions" if it doesn't exist:
$ mkdir -p ~/.nautilus/python-extensions

After that, extract the source tarball and copy the nautilusvim.py to
~/.nautilus/python-extensions:
$ cp nautilusvim.py ~/.nautilus/python-extensions/

Restart nautilus(execute "nautilus -q") and try to right click on the file(s)
you want to edit, you will see the changes in the context menu("Edit with
gVim" when only one file is selected, and "Diff with gVim", "Edit with Multi
gVim", "Edit with a Single gVim" are present when several files are selected),
just like what it is like on Windows.
